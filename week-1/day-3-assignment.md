## Week 1 - Assignment 3 - Functions

### Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Understand JS syntax
* Demonstrate understanding of types, functions, argument-handling, loops, and conditional statements

### Details

Instructions

* `cd` into your project folder
* `mkdir <projectName>`, e.g. 'day-3-functions'
* `git init`
* `curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ambethia/3d472a76f5da83fb5d71/raw/functions.js`

* `node functions.js`

Modify `functions.js` to make the tests/assertions pass.

**Note**: The first two problems are the last two we didn't finish in class.

### Normal Mode

- [ ] All assertions in functions.js pass
- [ ] Turn in the homework as a repository on Github. Link to it in a comment on this issue.

#### Additional Resources

You might need to reference these to find what kind of helpful functions might already be on `Array` and `String` in JavaScript.

- [String Functions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).
- [Array Functions on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array).

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] If you used any methods like `Array`'s `.reverse()` in your solutions, implemet the functions again without them.
- [ ] If you didn't use many built-in functions, look through the MDN documentation linked above and see if you can make use of any to refactor your code.
