## What we learned today

Homework Review. The homework was a little more "mathy" than expected. We talked about sourcing code; understanding what you turn in.
We worked through some more function stuff in class, map, reduce, filter, forEach, etc.
We talked about anonymous functions as callbacks.

Homework was Roshambo (rock-paper-scissors).
