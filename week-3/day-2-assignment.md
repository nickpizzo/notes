### Objectives

* Understand SASS/SCSS and Jade Preprocessors
* Understand Flexbox
* Understand the Gulp build system

### Deliverables

- [ ] a git repo containing `sass` and `jade` files.
- [ ] a working, publicly visible website with a public URL (i.e. on Github Pages).

## Explorer Mode

- [ ] If you haven't already, watch this video series: [What the Flexbox?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj7NZ6FiQvo&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid)
- [ ] Use `gulp` to automate the processing of your source files
- [ ] Use `SCSS/SASS` to author your stylesheets
- [ ] Use `Jade` to author your `HTML` documents
- [ ] Use `flexbox` in your stylesheets to layout the elements
- [ ] Use `@media` queries to handle a responsive layout

Feel free to refer to the [`Gulpfile.js`](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-js-q3-2015/notes/blob/master/week-3/day-1-class/paws-of-love/gulpfile.js) we did in class today.

## Adventure Mode

- [ ] Use Gulp to automate creating and updating a `gh-pages` branch that contains just your publishable documents (the generated `html` and `css`). _**hint**: Check the Additional Resources for something that might help with this!_
