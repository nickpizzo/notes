# Iron News

## Description

One of the basic, foundational news portals for professional web developers is "Hacker News," which is kind of like a Reddit for the startup/design/development community with a very... minimalist design ethic.

This weekend's lab is to build our own Iron News!

I've provided a backend API and Documentation for you at https://iron-news.herokuapp.com

Example API endpoint: `https://iron-news.herokuapp.com/articles`

### Deliverables

- [ ] A publicly visible website on `gh-pages`
- [ ] A repository on GitHub with your app's source code

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Reimplement the home page of Hacker News but with The Iron Yard flare. Try to match the styling of the main home page with the story numbers, the upvote triangle, the name of the link (clickable).
- [ ] Clicking on the upvote triangle should increase the vote count for the article via the API.
- [ ] Clicking on comments link should take you to a different page listing the comments for a given article.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] A form to submit articles
- [ ] A form to submit comments
- [ ] Implement the search function (Note as of writing this I have not added this to the API, if you want to attempt this part, let me know and I'll get that added)
